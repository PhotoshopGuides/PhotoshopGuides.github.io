## Miscellaneous

Here are some rules or you can say tips & etiquettes you should follow.
Though these settings does not falls into any specific catagory but they do help to make your experience better while using photoshop.

### Remove unwanted fonts (Highly recomended)
A number of fonts installed on your system will affect the loading time, as well as the working performance, of both Windows, and especially of Photoshop. So I recommend you to uninstall unwanted fonts from your computer and get rid of fonts you never use, and never will. This will also improve the loading time of Photoshop.

### EMERGENCY DUMP – PURGE PHOTOSHOP
One good thing about being around for a while (Using Photoshop for 20 years) is that we learned to be super efficient while working because computer resources were very tight. A lot of people newer to the Photoshop games aren’t even aware of this feature. Have you ever worked on a huge file and you can’t run a filter because there isn’t enough free memory. (Not enough free memory error message). You can do an emergency dump and actually complete that task without restarting your pc or photoshop.

> Choose Edit -> Purge -> All

### Disable Layers And Channels Preview

In Layers, Channels and Paths Photoshop shows small thumbnails of the image. Consequently, the more layers you have, the more memory is spending.
> To decrease or turn off the preview, go to Panel Options and Turn off the Preview.

### Decrease the amount of patterns and brushes in Photoshop CC
Photoshop brushes, patterns and layer styles significantly overload the system. Besides, each of them overloads little by little and as a result, the system is clogged with junk, that is rarely used.
> To see the patterns in Photoshop go to the menu Edit > Preset Manager and choose Preset Type > Patterns или Brushes.

### Use The Images With 8-Bit Colour Depth
Photoshop can work with 8-, 16- and 32- bit images. However, as a rule, for tasks that are not related to professional photo correction and preparation for print, it's enough to work with 8-bit images.

> To change your file to 8-bit can be done to Image > Mode > 8 Bits/Channel. This will immediately reduce the file size, and thus reduce system load by half.

### Watch The Efficiency Indicator
The efficiency indicator will show you when Photoshop will deplete the available memory and start to save data to the page file(scratch disk).
To display an indicator, press an arrow under your image and choose Efficiency.
The values below 90-95% indicate that Photoshop is using page file(scratch disk), and consequently this slows down the system and points out that you should provide more memory in photoshop settings or add RAM to your computer.

### Run Photoshop CC in 64-bit mode
When using launching Photoshop CC, you'll notice two options (depending on version). One is Photoshop CC (64 bit); the other is Photoshop CC. The 32-bit version can only use between 1.7 and 3GB of RAM, while the 64-bit version can use as much RAM as your computer will hold. So depending on your system configuration, choosing this option can help speed things up considerably.

### RESET PHOTOSHOP PREFERENCES TO FIX MOST PROBLEMS
This fix has been around as long as Photoshop, it’s just easier to do now.
When all else fails, resetting your preferences can fix most issues. Make sure to back up your presets first.
When you trash your preferences file, Photoshop builds a new preferences file as it launches and resets all the settings and libraries to the factory settings. This resets everything and removes bad presets etc. Most of the time this will fix Photoshop problems. Case in point, some people were freaking out (Some youtubers had a melt-down) with some bugs when they upgraded to CC 2019. Resetting the Preferences actually fixed the bugs.
> Press and hold Alt+Control+Shift (Windows) or Option+Command+Shift (Mac OS) as you start Photoshop. You will be prompted to delete
> current settings. The new preferences files will be created the next time you start Photoshop.
> Note: Using the keyboard shortcut, preference files for custom shortcuts, workspaces, and color settings will also be reset to default.
