## Tools

- [ ] **1. Uncheck Show Tootips (Optional)**

Tool Tips have been around in Photoshop since forever, and they're a great way to help new Photoshop users learn their way around the program. With Tool Tips enabled (which they are by default), hovering your mouse cursor over a tool in the Toolbar pops up the name of the tool along with its handy keyboard shortcut. Here's what a traditional Tool Tip looks like as I hover my cursor over the Move Tool:

In Photoshop CC 2018, Adobe has introduced Rich Tool Tips. Instead of just a small, simple text box, we now have a much larger box that's, well, pretty much impossible to ignore. Along with the tool's name, keyboard shortcut and a brief description of what the tool is used for, Rich Tool Tips also include a video animation showing the tool in action:
In theory, Rich Tool Tips sound like a good idea. Who wouldn't want an animation showing how the tool works? Of course, the simple answer is, anyone who already knows how it works. And even if you haven't yet learned how to use the tool, you still won't know just by watching a 5 or 6 second animation. So while they sound great in theory, Rich Tool Tips don't offer much value in the real world. In fact, they can quickly become annoying, taking up too much space on the screen without any real purpose for being there.

- [ ] **3. Uncheck Enable gestures**

In Photoshop, two-fingered touch gestures are used to control the location, rotation, and scaling of the image canvas view. Users may alternate between touch view control and other interactions using the mouse or stylus. Touch control of the view is very convenient when painting on large monitors which are difficult to rotate physically and on tablets and touch displays. But its is pritty useless if you are using a treditional input device like a Mouse. To disable touch gestures

    Preferences → Tools → uncheck: Enable gestures

- [ ] **4. Uncheck Enable Flick Paning**

There is no photoshop user who dosent use hand tool, While this tool allows user to quickly pan around large image while zoomed in. So, if you were to click with the hand tool, drag (or flick) the image and then release the hand tool, the image will continue to move across the window with a kind of 'gliding' motion.
Flick Paning is the ability to have the image move as if it has some kinetic energy.
While panning an image if you release the mouse button while the mouse is still in motion this will flick the image such that the image will continue to move even though you re not holding it with your mouse anymore. The image will contineue to glide in the direction you flicked it. While to some users this can be visually apealing but for some users it can be quite annoying sometimes. To disable Flick Paning

    Preferences → Tools → and uncheck Enable Flick Paning
As a side note, Flick Panning requires OpenGL drawing.
