## General 
##### Under Options Section

- [ ] **1. Uncheck Auto show the home screen (disable's huge home screen)**

When you launch Photoshop you will see a welcome screen that takes over the entire window. This can be useful by showing Recent files as well as access to your Lightroom photos. However, when you close your document, instead of showing a blank Photoshop window, it goes back to this huge screen, If you don't like this new interface and choose to disable it, it’s easy.

    Preferences -> General -> uncheck: Disable the Home Screen 

If unchecking the option does not disable the home screen then follow these steps

Edit - Preferences - General - Uncheck "auto show home screen" - Then reset preferences on quit - Ok - prompt - ok - then "cancel" out of here
Then Ctr+N and create a new canvas. Then close everything down. Reopen Photoshop and hopefully, like me, it will finally be gone


- [ ] **2. Uncheck Use Legacy "New Document" Interface. (disable's huge new document dialog)**

Have you noticed the New Document window keeps growing? If you want to go back to the old one, here is how.
Under General, turn on Use Legacy “New Document” interface.
And now the regular dialog box will show. If you want easy access to Templates, use the new dialog box, not the old (legacy) one.

    Preferences -> General -> check: "Use Legacy 'New Document' interface"

- [ ] **3. Uncheck "Export to Clipboard"**

Export to the clipboard is only useful if you’re copying things from Photoshop and pasting them into other applications. Why would you do such a thing?
I have seen people copy and paste images in Photoshop to combine them into 1 document. When you copy, you put that image into your memory and it will stay there until you restart your computer or you copy something else. It’s better to drag&drop images from one window to the other and leave that memory free for other things

    Preferences -> General -> uncheck: Export to Clipboard

- [ ] **4. Resize image during place. (Personal preference)**

While this option can be useful for some users, but for some it might be a real pain. Photoshop have this weird bug that when you drag an image from the desktop onto the canvas, Photoshop keeps upscaling it. Or distort your image's aspect ratio. 
While this issue is very rare and not seen in newer versions of Photoshop if you are facing such an issue or even not and want to do things your way. you can disable this option.

    Preferences -> General -> uncheck: Resize image during place
