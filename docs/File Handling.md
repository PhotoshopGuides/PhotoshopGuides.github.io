## File Handling
##### Under File Saving Options - 

**1. Image Previews**

Image previews are a thumbnail version of your file. They are useful when you’re browsing through folders in finder/explorer, but they also slow you down every time you save. Go ahead and set it to Never Save.

    Preferences -> File Handling -> Set "Image Previews" To -> Never Save

##### Under File Compatibility Options -

**1. Maximize PSD and PSB File Compatibility**

is a dialog box that pops up the first time you save something in Photoshop. If you choose yes, it will make it easier to open your files in different versions of Photoshop, but it will also add a fair amount of bloat to your file.
If you work with other people who have different versions of Photoshop, you want to set this to Always. If you are working by yourself, set it to Never. Either way, you won’t have to see that annoying pop-up anymore

    Preferences → File Handling → and set Maximize PSD and PSB File Compatibility according to your preference.

**2. Recent File List Contains xxx Files. (Personal preference)**

When you choose File > Open Recent, you will see your last 20 images. You can change that to show the last 5 or 100 documents you've worked previously.
Choose Preferences>File Handling.
Change recent files to preference. You don’t need to restart for this one, and it will immediately show the last 100 files.
